# **Setup**
Simultaneous Autoregressive Model

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \rho\sum w_i(Y_i-\beta_0 - \beta_1X_i)$$
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \rho\sum w_iY_i$$

$\rho$ describes the degree of correlation with neighbors; if $\rho$ value is close to 1, it weights heavily and if $\rho$ value is close to 0, not much weight
$w_i$ is the weight on neighbor $i$. 

$Y_i-\beta_0 - \beta_1X_i$ is the residual!!

- Data tidying process

```{r}
# refined dataset
chicago_sf
```

```{r}
# create a visualization to see if all of the neighborhoods of Chicago are included in the dataset
ggplot(chicago_sf) +
  geom_sf(color = "grey", fill = "lightblue") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Neighborhoods Map of Chicago")

# overlay the locations of grecery store
ggplot(chicago_sf) +
  geom_sf(color = "grey", fill = "lightblue") +
  # grocery store locations in points
  geom_sf(data = grocery_store, size = 1, aes(color = status)) +

2. What type of geometry does chicago_sup have? Would we consider this area or point pattern data?
- point

# Visualize

```{r}
# left one is point pattern, and the right one is areal, at this point can't really directly compare the two
ggplot(chicago_sf) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = Per_cap_income)) + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = colorspace::heat_hcl(10)) + 
  geom_sf(data = grocery_store) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(fill = "Per Capita\nIncome", 
       title = "Locations of grocery stores, 2020")
```


```{r}
# converted the point pattern data to areal data so that the comparison can be done 
ggplot(chicago_sf) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = grocery_100k)) + 
  scale_fill_fermenter(palette = 2, direction = 1) + 
  labs(fill = "Grocery stores\nper 100k people") + 
  theme_bw()
```


# Moran's I review

3. Comparing the plots of Per capita income and Grocery stores per 100k, which variable do you think has stronger spatial autocorrelation? 

Whether we are looking at per capita income or at number of grocery stores, we start by creating the neighbors (nb) and the neighbor weights (nbw).

```{r}
# Create neigbors
chicago_nb <- poly2nb(chicago_sf, queen = TRUE)
# Create neighbor weights
chicago_nbw <- nb2listw(chicago_nb, style = "W", zero.policy = TRUE)
```

4. What does the code below do? Interpret the result.
```{r}
moran.mc(chicago_sf$num_grocery, chicago_nbw, nsim = 499)
```

There is a moderately strong spatial autocorrelation (I = .51) 

```{r}
moran.mc(chicago_sf$num_grocery, chicago_nbw, nsim = 499)
```

There is a strong spatial autocorrelation (I = .69) in the percentage of residents of a neighborhood that identify as White.
Neighborhoods tend to have similar percentage of white residents as their neighbors.

5. Repeat #4 using the grocery_100k variable. Interpret the result.

```{r}
moran.mc(chicago_sf$grocery_100k, chicago_nbw, nsim = 499)
```

There is a weaker spatial autocorrelation (I = .13) in the 


6. Comparing Per capita income and Grocery stores per 100k in #4 and #5, which variable do you think has stronger spatial autocorrelation? 



# Regression
Start by exploring relationships with other variables:
```{r}
ggplot(chicago_sf) + 
  geom_point(aes(Per_cap_income, grocery_100k))

ggplot(chicago_sf) + 
  geom_point(aes(Pct_white, grocery_100k))  

ggplot(chicago_sf) + 
  geom_point(aes(Per_cap_income, log(grocery_100k)))


ggplot(chicago_sf) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = Pct_white), color = "white") + 
  scale_fill_fermenter() + 
  geom_sf(data = grocery_store) + 
  theme_bw()
```

Start by fitting a linear regression model: 
```{r}
lm1 <- lm(grocery_100k ~ Pct_white, data= chicago_sf)
plot(lm1, 1)
summary(lm1)
```

Join residuals to sf and Plot Residuals:
```{r}
chicago_sf$resid1 <- residuals(lm1)
```


7. Using ggplot, make a chloropleth map of the residuals. 

```{r}
# looking at the colors of graph, the assumption of independent is violated, so ordinary linear regression method cannot be performed in here
ggplot(chicago_sf) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = resid1), color = "white") + 
  scale_fill_gradient2()
```



8. Check moran's I:
```{r}
moran(chicago_sf$resid1, 
                       chicago_nbw, 
                       n = length(chicago_nb), 
                       S0 = Szero(chicago_nbw))
```

Fit spatial regression:
```{r}
sarlm1 <- lagsarlm(grocery_100k ~ Pct_white, data = chicago_sf, listw = chicago_nbw)

summary(sarlm1)
```

- $\rho=$ 0.06; spatial autocorrelation in the number of grocery stores in neighboring communities is pretty low 
- if $\rho$ is small, OLS is a good model. if $\rho$ is big, OLS is not to be trusted. 

9. Compare the SAR (lagsarlm) and OLS (lm) models. Look at estimates of slope and intercept, the standard error, and p-value.


10. Write 2-3 concluding sentences about what you learned of the distribution of grocery stores throughout Chicago. Consider including ideas from your background readings.

- we caanot conclude satistical significance that regions with white people are correlated with more grocery store. Yet, aggregation and confounding variables exists in our analysis. It is also important to note that the graphs paint a different story than our original statistical analysis.

_ **Interpretation**: For every \% point increase in white residents, number of groceries per 100,000 residents is predicted to increase 1.002 times (or by .2\%).
